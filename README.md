# RAG-LLM-for-Paper-Question-Answering
This repository provides a framework for creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model specifically designed for answering questions from academic papers. The model leverages both pre-trained Language Models (LLMs) and a custom retrieval mechanism to enhance its ability to accurately locate and generate responses from research documents.

### Use Cases:
- Academic research assistance.
- Automated literature review.
- Contextual question answering from complex scientific texts.

### Installation and Usage:
Instructions on how to install dependencies, set up the environment, and run the model are provided in the repository.

### Contributions:
We welcome contributions to improve the model, add features, and expand its applicability. Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.
