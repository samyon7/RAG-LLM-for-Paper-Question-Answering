# RAG-LLM-for-Paper-Question-Answering
This repository provides a framework for creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model specifically designed for answering questions from academic papers. The model leverages both pre-trained Language Models (LLMs) and a custom retrieval mechanism to enhance its ability to accurately locate and generate responses from research documents.
